                    &emsp;Paul Price is the current principle of the school since the class year of 2015-2016 and
                    favored by most teachers and other administration.
                    However, most students disagree with his new administration. He enforced such school rules
                    like absolutely no food or drink in any classroom, tardies being strictly monitored and quickly
                    giving consequences of having too many, cellular devices not being allowed during lunch or transitions,
                    removal of <a href="other/fifthquarter.html" class="keyword"> 5th quarter</a>, and
                    enforcing parking lot organization.

                <p class="subsummary">
                    &emsp;Brad Lewis is the disciplinary administrative and vice principle of North. 
                    He is mostly disliked by students due to his very authoritive and enforced action toward the 
                    rule-breaking students at the school. He is often seen with the resource officer, patrolling
                    the <a href="locations/courtyard.html" class="keyword">cafeteria</a> and hallways.
                    He enforces tardies and skipping, handing out ISS and detention 
                    write-ups to anyone he can. When giving consequences to students, he walks into the 
                    student's current class and asks him or her to step outside for a moment to discuss what he
                    wants to discuss. Every start of each semester, he pops into every classroom
                    to observe which classes are more or less orderly.

                <p class="subsummary">
                    &emsp;Mrs. Kimberly Brown is one of the assistant principles at the school. She is not see very
                    often around the school, she is usually in office by the door in front of the theatre room leading 
                    to the <a href="locations/courtyard.html" class="keyword">courtyard</a>. She is mostly 
                    neutral to most of the male students at the school, however the young ladies at the school dislike
                    for her enforcement of girl dress code. Many girls complain about Brown taking it too seriously, as 
                    girls and boys see no problem with anything she punishes for.
